# Iron Cipher Mark I

## Description

Iron Cipher Mark I is a simple encryption and decryption tool that allows users to input a word, encrypt it using a basic cipher, and then decrypt it back to the original word. The app also provides the option to store the ciphered data in a JSON file for later use.

## Features

- **Encryption**: Encrypt a word using a simple cipher and view the encrypted result.
- **Decryption**: Decrypt an encrypted word back to its original form.
- **Data Persistence**: Save encrypted data to a JSON file for future reference.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built using `customtkinter` for a clean, easy-to-use graphical interface.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `customtkinter` library

## Usage

1. Run the Python application: python ui.py
2. Enter a word into the "Encrypt" tab to see the encrypted result.
3. Switch to the "Decrypt" tab to reverse the encryption and get the original word back.
