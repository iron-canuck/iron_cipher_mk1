## Description

Iron Cipher Mark I: your no-nonsense, simple encryption and decryption tool. Input a word, encrypt it using a basic cipher, and decrypt it back to the original using the same key. You can even decrypt other words with that key, keeping things flexible and secure.

## Features

- **Encryption**: Enter a word, encrypt it, and watch the magic happen.
- **Decryption**: Take that encrypted word, flip it, and get back to the real deal.
- **Data Persistence**: Save that ciphered data in a neat JSON file for future reference.
- **Sleek Interface**: Built with `customtkinter`—because we like things clean and smooth.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x (we’re not cavemen here)
- `customtkinter` library (don’t worry, it's a breeze)

## Usage

1. **Launch the app**: `python ui.py`
2. **Enter a word** in the "Encrypt" tab. Watch it get encrypted.
3. **Switch over to "Decrypt"** to reverse it and get the original word back.

## Creative Uses for Iron Cipher Mark I

- **Teach Cryptography**: Break it down, show how simple ciphers work. Bonus points for using it to explain data security.
- **Encrypt Your Notes**: No one needs to see your private thoughts. Encrypt 'em and keep 'em safe.
- **Secure Messages**: Need to keep a secret? Send encrypted messages with a little extra flair.
- **Create Puzzle Clues**: Make your escape room or treasure hunt way cooler with encrypted clues.
- **Obfuscate Data**: Testing or learning programming? Obfuscate your data like a pro.
- **Personalized Messages**: Send a cryptic, encrypted message to your friend or loved one—it’s like adding a little mystery to your gift.
- **Encrypt Files**: Protect small text files or sensitive data. Store it securely in JSON. Simple and effective.
